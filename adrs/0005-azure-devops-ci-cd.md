# 0005. CI CD pipeline.

Date: 31-08-2020

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need tooling for creating a CI/CD pipeline as well as hosting source code.

## Decision

We chose azure devops. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/

They offer free git repos and CI/CD pipelines.

## Consequences

Github may also be a contender now they support github actions.
