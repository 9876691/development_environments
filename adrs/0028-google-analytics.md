# 0028. Use google analytics for visitor tracking.

Date: 28-08-2020

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to monitor site usage. i.e. how popular are certian blog posts etc.

## Decision

We chose google analytics.

It's free and comes with a lot of functionality.

We considered some of the alternatives, those that claim to respect privacy and GDPR but for the moment we have expereince with GA.

## Consequences

There may be a need going forward for a GDPR notice and perhaps we may want to think about wether we track less.
