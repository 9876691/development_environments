# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 28-08-2020

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

The decision records must be stored in a plain text format:

* This works well with version control systems.

* It allows the tool to modify the status of records and insert
  hyperlinks when one decision supercedes another.

* Decisions can be read in the terminal, IDE, version control
  browser, etc.

People will want to use some formatting: lists, code examples,
and so on.

People will want to view the decision records in a more readable
format than plain text, and maybe print them out.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

Record architecture decisions in [Markdown format](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above.
